## 🔍 Overview

**Doctor Hunter** is a console-based doctor recommendation system built using C++. It helps patients find suitable doctors based on their medical complaints. The system uses Object-Oriented Programming principles to manage doctor data, interpret patient input, and suggest relevant specialists.

## 🧠 Core Idea

- Patients describe their symptoms (e.g., `"chest pain"`, `"skin rash"`, `"headache"`)
- The system matches these symptoms to known medical problems
- Each problem is mapped to a list of doctors using an `unordered_map`
- Doctors are recommended based on specialization, rating, and location
